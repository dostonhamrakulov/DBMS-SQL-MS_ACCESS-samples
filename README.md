## Database and object technology

Here, I have three different practical works from Database Management System course, 2016

### Programming languages

## Practical work_1:
### 1. practical work. Database design and implementation

    1. Choose topic (shop, school, university, airport etc.)
    2. Give short description of chosen topic
    3. Design database conceptual model using CASE tool PowerDesigner (ER model)
        a. At least 5 entities
        b. 1:1, 1:N, N:M and unary relationships
        c. data types for attributes
        d. constraints and data validation rules
    4. Generate logical data model in the tool and explore and describe the changes in model
    5. Specify database management system “MS Access” and generate database physical model.
    6. Generate the SQL script file from generated database physical model.
    7. Generate database in MS Access.
    8. Verify the generated database correspondence to initially designed conceptual model

## Practical work_2:
### 2. SQL basic constructs
1. Using commands create, insert, update create 3 tables (create structure, define constraints, enter data) (you can use tables designed in Practical Assignment #1).
2. Create the following types of SQL queries: 
    1) query with one table and multiple conditions in WHERE clause;
    2) query with two related tables and multiple conditions in WHERE clause;
    3) query with grouping GROUP BY;
    4) query with grouping and HAVING clause (contitions for groups);
In queries include predicates LIKE together with "?", "*", &;  and predicates ANY; ALL; IN; BETWEEN; DISTINCT.
In queries include functions COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), AVG(), LEFT(), RIGHT().
In queries include expressions (e.g. addition and subtraction).
3. Conclusions

## Practical work_3:
### 3. practical work. SQL – subqueries and joins
1. Using commands CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE create at least 3 tables (create structure, define constraints, enter data) (you can use tables designed in Practical Assignment #1 or #2).
2. Create the following types of SQL queries: 
    1) query with subquery in SELECT clause;
    2) query with subquery in FROM clause; 
    3) query with subquery in WHERE clause;
    4) query with UNION construction;
    5) query with EXISTS construction;
    6) at least 3 queries with JOIN; 
    7) at least 3 queries with LEFT JOIN;
    8) at least 3 queries with RIGHT JOIN;
    9) query with FULL JOIN.

In queries include predicates LIKE together with "?", "*", &;  and predicates ANY; ALL; IN; BETWEEN; DISTINCT.
In queries include functions COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), AVG(), LEFT(), RIGHT().
3. Conclusions.

## Practical work_4:
### 4. practical work. Forms and Reports
Create one report with at least 2 levels of grouping and aggregation functions; alternative data should be represented, e.g., date printed, page X of N, etc.
Create form, that allows enter data, format it properly, assign readable names to control elements (e.g., txt prefix for textboxes, cmb for command buttons etc. - for whole list of prefixes see lecture slides). Add some controls to navigate between records. Show other features of form creation and design you have learned!
Unnecessary data should be hidden from the user. (p.s. I can suggest you form tasks after you submit DB design).

Submit a report with short description how this form and report could be used, and necessary screenshots.
All screenshots should be provided, explaining step by step how you create, modify, view the the report and form.

If it is not written in report (Word, PDF), it's not done!
3. Conclusions.
